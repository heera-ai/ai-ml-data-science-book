# Chapter 2: Machine Learning Basics

In this chapter, we'll delve into the basics of machine learning (ML) and its key concepts and techniques.

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

### Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning:** In supervised learning, the algorithm learns from labeled data, making predictions or decisions based on input-output pairs.
2. **Unsupervised Learning:** Unsupervised learning involves learning patterns and structures from unlabeled data, clustering similar data points or discovering hidden patterns.
3. **Reinforcement Learning:** Reinforcement learning is about learning optimal decision-making strategies through trial and error, with feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

There are various machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Linear Regression:** Used for predicting continuous values based on input features.
- **Decision Trees:** Tree-like models used for classification and regression tasks.
- **Random Forest:** Ensemble method combining multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Used for classification and regression tasks, effective in high-dimensional spaces.
- **Neural Networks:** Deep learning models with layers of interconnected nodes, capable of learning complex patterns.

### Machine Learning Process

1. **Data Collection:** Gather relevant data for training and testing the ML model.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean, transform, and prepare the data for training.
3. **Model Selection:** Choose an appropriate ML algorithm based on the problem and data.
4. **Training:** Train the model using the training data to learn patterns and relationships.
5. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using testing data and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the trained model for real-world predictions or applications.

Stay tuned for practical examples and hands-on exercises in machine learning in the upcoming chapters.
